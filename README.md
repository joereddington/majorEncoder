# majorEncoder
Produces mnemonics from numbers using Derren Brown's encoding.  

Running live at http://joereddington.com/major/majorEncoder.php and demonstrated with a nicer interface at: http://joereddington.com/projects/tool-for-finding-keywords-for-major-analysis/ 



This tool uses the numbering system shown by Derren Brown in the excellent book Trick of the mind. For a (much better) tool that uses the older numbering system see http://www.rememberg.com/





# TODO 

* Make the Algoritm APIs a little more consistent with each other  
* More tests and refactoring 


# Markov 
  * Is extremely slow 
  * Doesn't do the same 'by group' as the others.

# Brute 
  * There's a lot of bad words in the wordlist. 
  * Might see if I can force words of at least size 2. 

# Structure 
* Is oddly complicated
